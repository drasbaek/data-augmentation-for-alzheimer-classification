# Assignment 4 (Self-Assigned): Data Augmentation for Alzheimers Classifications

## Description
This repository forms the solution to self-chosen assignment 4 by Anton Drasbæk Schiønning (202008161) in the course "Visual Analytics" at Aarhus University.

This project attempts to classify varying degrees of the alzheimers diseased based on MRI data using a pre-trained CNN. The scope of the analysis is to test whether data augmentation can be used to improve the performance of the model, and if so, which augmentation methods are the most effective?
